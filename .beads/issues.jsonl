{"id":"ncp-es-tests","title":"event-stream: Write tests","description":"Write comprehensive tests for event-stream tool covering all scenarios (doc/adr/03-event-streaming.md Phase 6 Testing). Test suite includes: basic subscription (no filters, all events), event type filtering (subscribe to only WindowsChanged), field filtering (windows on specific output), complex filters (multiple filter expressions AND'ed together), error handling (invalid JSON, niri crash), disconnection (client disconnects mid-stream), concurrent subscriptions (multiple tool calls spawn isolated bridges), and subprocess cleanup (verify niri processes killed on disconnect).\n\n**Test Approach:** Spawn mock niri subprocess, trigger window changes programmatically, verify events appear in SSE stream with correct format, verify filtering reduces output, verify SSE format matches specification (event: / data: lines), verify cleanup works properly on disconnect/error.\n\n**Coverage Goals:** Verify transport setup, EventBridge parsing/filtering, SSE formatter, tool registration, and subprocess lifecycle management all work correctly.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-21T23:28:59.770874702-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-21T23:28:59.770874702-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ncp-es-tests","depends_on_id":"ncp-es","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-21T23:29:17.021283333-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
